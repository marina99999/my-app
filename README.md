# Getting Started with Create React App

## E-Portfolio about React JS

How to get started:

1.Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

2.Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3.create a Folder where you want to save your Project

4.To install the create-react-app generator, in a terminal or command prompt type:
npm install -g create-react-app

5.Open command prompt and switch with cd to the Folder where you want to save your Project

6.Type npx create-react-app my-app -> my-app is the name of your Project you can change that
This may take a few minutes

7.If it's finished type cd my-app then you have to install bootstrap with: npm install bootstrap
and start your project to test with npm start

If you want to look at the detailed description you can go to https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial/

## Demo

If you want to follow the Demo you should load the Code from the Card.js File and follow the instructions from above

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
